  * Fix bug which caused 0.4.0 not to install correctly!
  * Bug fixes
    * Don't hijack result blocks from other code blocks.  Previously, if there were two code blocks and a result
      block, executing the first code block would be the results in the result block.  Only the second one should.

    * Underline
    * Creating Links
    * Creating Tables
    * Create code blocks

  * Early support for code execution in Objective-C
    * Currently I call "clang -lobjc -framework Foundation -o <temp output file> <temporary filename>" to compile.
    * Just as with the others above, this will need better support for libraries
  * Bug fixes
    * If you are on a level N outline and there is already a level N+1 indent underneath and you press return, then
      new line should be on level N+1, not on level N.

      editor.outdentSelectedRows() respectively.
    * Tags were able to include spaces, which made some rather unusual things being matched.

      continue to use that outline type.

  * Syntax highlighting for SCHEDULED tags on outline items.
  * Syntax highlighting for tags
  * Fixed bugs
    * If you weren't at the end of the line when you pressed return, the text after your cursor was deleted.
    * If your cursor was before the star, the behavior would be incorrect.
